      <description>Within git, the default branch is usually named master, however in recent times, the negative connotations of that word are coming to the forefront of a lot of people&amp;rsquo;s minds, and so they are wishing to diverge away from that kind of terminology. The simplest change that we can make is to default to the HEAD branch of a repo, which will point towards whatever the actual default branch is for a the repo, whether that is master, main or Captain.</description>
