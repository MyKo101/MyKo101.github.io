  abstract={Analysis of competing risks is commonly achieved through a cause specific or a subdistribution framework using Cox or Fine {\&} Gray models, respectively. The estimation of treatment effects in observational data is prone to unmeasured confounding which causes bias. There has been limited research into such biases in a competing risks framework.},
