Michael Barrowman is a Data Scientist providing independent statistical analysis. With a background in both the public and private sector and a wealth of experience working with medical and education datasets. He has produced stunning visualisations for previous clients as well as publication-ready reports and production ready scripts. He maintains several publicly available software packages for data analysis as well as internal client-based ones.

He is currently finalising his Thesis on Multi-State Clinical Prediction Models in Renal Replacement Therapy as a PhD Candidate within the University of Manchester. His PhD project encompasses the development and validation of a multi-state clinical predication model, as well as the methodological advancements to produce such a model. This has led to multiple publications and the creation of software as a by-product.

He is interested in Data Science, particularly using R and RStudio to their fullest potential, encouraging others to do the same and is an advocate for neat and reproducible coding practices. He also enjoys learning new programming languages and has become adept at C++, Kotlin and Python.

He lives in Merseyside, UK with his partner, two children and two step-children. He enjoys walks down by the local canal, through nearby forested areas and trips to the park as often as possible as his daughter's favourite outdoor activity is "going on adventures".
