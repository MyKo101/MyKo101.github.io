Michael Barrowman is currently finalising his Thesis on Multi-State Clinical Prediction Models in Renal Replacement Therapy as a PhD Candidate within the University of Manchester, whilst tutoring Maths, Stats & IT at Liverpool John Moores University.

His PhD project encompasses the development and validation of a multi-state clinical predication model, as well as the methodological advancements to produce such a model. This has led to multiple publications and the creation of software as a by-product.

He has previously worked within both the public and private sector providing data analysis to many industries, particularly education and health. During this time, he has contributed to SAPs and SOPs for a pioneering pragmatic clinical trial and improved the efficiency of examination marking by over 10%. 

He is interested in Data Science, particularly using R and RStudio to their fullest potential, encouraging others to do the same and is an advocate for neat and reproducible coding practices.

He lives in Merseyside, UK with his wife and two children. They enjoy walks down by the local canal, visiting castles & historic monuments and camping in rural Scotland.
